fasm 1.73.30, all platforms
---

fasm is a project by Tomasz Grysztar ([http://flatassembler.net](<http://flatassembler.net>)). 
 Copyright to fasm belongs to him, per this [LICENSE](<LICENSE>).

This repository combines content of latest distribution archives for dos, win32, libc, and linux
 in a, presumably, uniform fashion.  I use it as a basis for fasm modding project, available
 elsewhere.

I have added [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile) to rebuild content of this repository from the
 original fasm distribution.  If you want to know how exactly original files are repackaged -
 or for you security paranoid types, whether I have tampered with an original (which I
 didn't) - go ahead and check it yourself.  You will get the peace of the mind at the expense
 of Tomasz's bandwidth.  You will owe him for that.
